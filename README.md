# MyfinalYearProject-NEXA-
#  AI-Driven Voice Based Intelligent Desktop Control System

An intelligent desktop assistant that enables users to control their computer using natural voice commands. The system combines Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Context Awareness, and Desktop Automation to provide a hands-free desktop experience.

---

##  Project Overview

The AI-Driven Voice Based Intelligent Desktop Control System allows users to interact with their computer through voice commands instead of traditional keyboard and mouse inputs.

The application captures voice input, converts it into text using speech recognition, identifies user intent through NLP techniques, and performs the corresponding desktop action automatically.

Examples:

- "Open Chrome"
- "Search for Machine Learning on Google"
- "Create a new folder"
- "Shutdown the system"
- "Find my resume PDF"

##  Problem Statement

Traditional desktop interaction depends heavily on keyboards and mice, which may not always be convenient.

This project aims to:

- Improve accessibility
- Enable hands-free computer operation
- Increase productivity
- Provide intelligent command understanding
- Support personalized user experiences

##  Installation

### Clone Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Voice-Desktop-Control.git
cd AI-Voice-Desktop-Control

Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

Activate environment:
Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run Project
python main.py

## Workflow
# Step 1: Voice Capture
The system records user voice input using the microphone.

# Step 2: Speech Recognition
Audio is processed and converted into text using Whisper Speech Recognition.

# Step 3: Intent Detection
The NLP engine identifies the user's intent.

# Examples:
Open Application
File Search
Web Search
System Control

# Step 4: Entity Extraction
Important entities such as:
Application Names
File Names
Search Queries
are extracted.

# Step 5: Context Analysis
User history and preferences are considered.

# Step 6: Command Execution
The requested action is executed automatically.

## Example Commands
Voice Command	Action
Open Chrome	Launches Chrome
Close Notepad	Closes Notepad
Search AI on Google	Opens browser and searches
Create Folder Projects	Creates folder
Shutdown Computer	Shuts down system
